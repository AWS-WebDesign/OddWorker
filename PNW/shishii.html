Washington state is home to some of the best natural displays of fall color in the world. Around mid to late October, the trees begin to turn vivid shades of yellow, orange, and red.

After dry or hot summers, fall foliage in Washington will be especially vibrant. Most parts of Washington State are experiencing drought conditions in 2019, though generally not in the Cascade foothills.

You can experience breathtaking hues of red, orange, and yellow, primarily from maple, ash, and aspen trees. In addition, shrubs and ground covers add still more color and texture, such as witch hazel, Oregon grape, dogwoods, spiraea, and native berries.

<h3>Picture 3</h3>
Between the Autumn Leaf Festival and Oktoberfest, fall is really the perfect time to swing by everyoneâ€™s favorite local Bavarian village. Nestled in the heart of the Cascade Mountains about two hours from Seattle and three hours from Spokane (with plenty of scenic and scrumptious stops along the way), Leavenworth offers a huge assortment of things to do and serves as a perfect jumping off point for local trails. Look for vine maples and cottonwoods with their stunning scarlet, orange and gold leaves. The drive west of Leavenworth on Highway 2 is also a feast for the eyes, as forests of dogwood, maple and alder shine against a backdrop of dark green conifers.
