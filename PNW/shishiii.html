Giant Pacific octopuses live up to their names. While they average 90 pounds, they’re known to weigh up to 150, with the largest authenticated weight coming in at 156 pounds. And their arm spans can be up to an incredible 20 feet across—about the height of a two-story building.

																											 Its scientific name, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), means, majestically, “the master crab.” The name Dungeness comes from a sandy, driftwood-strewn spit at the top of the Olympic Peninsula, between Seattle and Victoria, B.C., as the crow flies.

																											 Between the Autumn Leaf Festival and Oktoberfest, fall is really the perfect time to swing by everyone’s favorite local Bavarian village. Nestled in the heart of the Cascade Mountains about two hours from Seattle and three hours from Spokane (with plenty of scenic and scrumptious stops along the way), Leavenworth offers a huge assortment of things to do and serves as a perfect jumping off point for local trails. Look for vine maples and cottonwoods with their stunning scarlet, orange and gold leaves. The drive west of Leavenworth on Highway 2 is also a feast for the eyes, as forests of dogwood, maple and alder shine against a backdrop of dark green conifers.
