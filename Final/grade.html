        <td>The collection itself was very creative and fun to look at. There is plenty of information, but it would have benefitted from some more context (particularly the pages with the videos and the graphs). The links were clever, but without labels, I felt a little lost. Additionally, there was never a way to go back to the home page. Lastly the "lebron.html" page did not load. I assume this is because the file is called "lb.html"</td>
        <td>These webpages were a little confusing to manage. It seemed like you had some html files in your folder that were not used or linked to others in the end. The information and style you had worked well, but they lacked some organization. For example, the photos were captioned at the bottom rather than next to the photo and the links were in a "dropdown" section, yet there was not a dropdown but instead a hidden feature.</td>
        <td>Late Some interesting CSS style choices that made clicking the form harder to do. The outcomes worked, but the javascript function had a few errors. The outcomes were displayed as an alert and not results, which was not ideal. There was a lack of comments.</td>
<td>Absent - No Excuse Assigned
Great work on intellectual property. Very informative. I appreciate the multiple case studies. Good animation and transition. The small form use worked (+1). The comments could have been a bit more thorough.</td>
