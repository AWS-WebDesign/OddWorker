  <h2>What is the importance of Intellectual Property?</h2>
  <p><b>> The main purpose of Intellectual property is to encourage various creations of products as they give the creators</b></p>
  <p><b>the right to own and profit from their creations.</b></p>
  <p><b>> Without Intellectual Property, it would be more difficult for creators to claim ownership of their creations thus there would be less creations</b></p>
  <p><b>> In order for people to be able to take legal actions for what they've created, it would be safest to apply a patent or copyright for one's invention. </b></p>

  <h2>How do I claim my Intellectual Property?</h2>
  <p><b>> Claiming ownership of something related to intellectual property can be as easy as posting a picture you took on Instagram, </b></p>
  <p><b>it can also be as hard as going through the process of applying patent for your own creation.</b></p>
  <p><b>> If you really do think your idea/invention is valuable/original, it is definitely recommended to take legal actions.</b></p>
  <p><b>> People often think that their business name, products, or product brands will be copied, but it happens frequently, and you can lose income from it.</b></p>

  <p><b>> In many copyright/infringement cases, people are unaware of what they did, or just didn't know that they were "using" other people's work, which often leads to paying a decent amount of money to the copyright owner.</b></p>

  <p><b># don't use photographs for profiting without permission or without giving the proper credits </b></p>
  <p><b># don't create videos with unlicensed or unauthorized music clips</b></p>
  <p><b># don't copy books, blogs, or podcasts without permission</b></p>
  <p><b># don't record or take picture of licensed artworks such as a movie played in the theatre</b></p>
  <p><b># ALWAYS GIVE PROPER CITATION!!!</b></p>
